# pychat

This is a basic chat app written in python to demonstrate synchronous communication between the client and server. It achives this by using pythons threading function.

Features:

Stinky parts:
only one client can connect at a time

For mac users: Leave the ip/hostname box empty if you are running this on you local machine.
For windows users: even if you are running this only on your local machine you still need to type in your computers hostname.
